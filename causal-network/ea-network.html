//Writing: 
//While my previous post saw the world as a set of detached causes that could absorb money, 
//this one views it as more of a network.  Thinking of the world as a network is especially
//important when you expect the largest impacts of your actions to be indirect, or you're considering
//some type of upstream intervention like "Increasing the rate of economic growth", or 
//"strengthening healthcare systems", or "improving educational outcomes", or 
//"campaigning for a politician".  

//For demonstration purposes, have the cell with the smallest direct effect
//have the largest indirect one.  

// You have one click.  The direct impact of your click is proportional to the size of
// the circle.  But the circles are also connected to a network, with the secondary effects
// proportional to the size of the edges connecting the circles (to see the edge direction, hover over
// a circle). This is called a cyclic graph, so there can also be looping feedback between circles, 
// which eventually decays.

// Show vis here  

// It may seem like selecting circle D is the best approach to start because of it's large direct
// effect, but circles B and E outperform it because of their connections to the network. 
// Even though circle E has the smallest direct impact of 1, it has larger, diffuse effect on others.  
// So the point is that if you're working in a complex system, pay close attention to potential 
// indirect effects of your actions because they might be more important.  

// I chose some values for the network to demonstrate a point.   

// How it works
// Go over the math from the EA post, give credit to them.  
// Math is stolen from this post: http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1h9/test/

// Also show the matrix 

//Each row in this matrix represents the outgoing
//impact from a node on the others.  So for row a, 
//a 1 unit increase in a causes a 0.1 increase in e.  
//So if a is 5, e is 5*0.1 = 0.5, then the outgoing 
//impacts from e are calculated, which is 0.5*1.5 = 0.75 for
//a, b, c, d. These then propagate out.  Some of it returns to a ()
//and cycles out again (e.g. a->e = 0.75*0.1 = 0.075 again). 
//This infinite loop has a mathematical solution: 
//impact_vector*(I-M)^-1 is the total sum.
// As long as the feedback loop decays over time: 
// http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1h9/test/
// If they both have a feedback of > 1, it will continue indefinitely. 

// So if there is a loop anywhere, as long as the amount that returns
// to the starting point is lower than it was initially, it's not
// infinite.  I'm sure there's something hand-wavey here I could say about
// entropy closed in thermodynamic systems . . .  

//Conclusion

//I'm not interested in using models like this to actually make concrete predictions. 
//Instead, I just want to communicate general ideas to be aware of when making decisions about 
//prioritization.  Providing different mental models to switch between depending on the context.


//TODO: potentially implement a breadth first search that highlights all child branches
// beyond immediate one
//TODO: Add possible negative effects.  Will that work with current matrix multiplication?
// would also be interesting if you had one with negative direct effects, but large positive
// indirect effects. 


// TODO: add direct effect into results
// TODO: figure out mouseover/mouseout
